# TDSB school capacity

This is a short project to visualize surplus capacity in TDSB schools overlaid on both population change map and zoning map.

Data from the TDSB was provided from the [Long-term program and accommodation strategy](https://www.tdsb.on.ca/About-Us/Strategy-Planning/Long-Term-Program-and-Accommodation-Strategy).
I emailed the TDSB asking for an Excel sheet that they used to generate the school data PDF and they were happy to oblige.

Data from the Canadian census 2016 and 2021 was pulled using [Tongfen](https://github.com/mountainMath/tongfen), written by [Jens von Bergmann](https://mountainmath.ca/).

[Ward boundaries](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/city-wards/) and [zoning](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/zoning-by-law/) is from Open Data Toronto.
